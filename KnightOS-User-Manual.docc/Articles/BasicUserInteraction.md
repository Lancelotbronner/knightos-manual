# Basic User Interaction

How to start using KnightOS.

## Overview

KnightOS has some basic ideas around how you interact with the system and the
programs running on that system. Thought KnightOS is highly customizable, these
ideas persist through most KnightOS installations, and they certainly apply to the
base installation.

## Special Keys

There are a number of keys that have special meaning on KnightOS. Programs are
able to override these meanings, but they generally hold true.

- term Function Keys: 
The **F1**-**F5** keys are the uppermost keys on your
		calculator's keypad. They are labelled with their function number in green
		near the key. These keys have "meta" uses in KnightOS, and are used to
		interact with the system and programs on it.

- term Function 1:
		The **F1** key is used to return to the program launcher from other
		programs.  The active program will be suspended and you can select
		another.

- term Function 2-4:
		The three middle function keys have context-specific actions. These
		interact with whichever program you have open. Consult the documentation
		for each program to learn more.

- term Function 5:
		The **F5** key is used to switch between programs. It will take you
		to a list of running programs to choose from.

- term CLEAR:
		The **CLEAR** is often used to return to the previous screen. It
		works as a "Back" button, of sorts. It is also used as "Backspace"
		when editing text.

- term MODE:
		The "MODE" key will exit the current program.

- term 2ND, ENTER:
		The **2ND** and **ENTER** keys generally serve the same purpose
		- committing to a selection. The **2ND** key is included in this
		action because it is more natural to use it when also using the arrow
		keys.

- term Arrow Keys:
		The arrow keys are used to interact with menus and many screens on
		KnightOS. You can also use it, when editing text, to move your cursor.

- term ON:
		The **ON** key, in addition to starting the calculator, can be used
		for a number of "meta" uses. This gives you the ability to deal with
		troublesome situations, including killing a misbehaving program and
		running an immediate reboot. There is more information on this in section
		TODO.
